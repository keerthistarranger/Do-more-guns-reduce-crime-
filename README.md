Fixed Effects Models were used to find out if shall-issues law reduce crime or not in US
* We analysed historical data on crime in the US to answer the following questions:
    * “Do shall-issues law reduce crime-or not?”
    * “Does incarceration policy reduce crime-or not?”
* We ran Pooled OLS model, Entity- Fixed Effect model, Time-Effect-FE model for 3 dependent variables: Violence, Murder, Robbery Crime
* We found that both shall-issues and incarceration policy can reduce violent crime rates, but very minimally.
* We found that neither the implementation of shall-issue laws nor enforcing increased incarceration seemed to have any effect on robbery rates. However, the percentage of male population aged 10-29 did.
